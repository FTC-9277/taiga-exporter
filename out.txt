Minor adjustments were made to the corner brackets, and they were printed to be much stronger to be used on the robot. The drive train was bolted together, and holes were drilled to put the motor mounts at exactly 60 degrees with less than 1 degree tolerance. However, the first arrangement of the motors made the robot too big, so the motors on the wide end were flipped inwards to made the robot fit inside the 18x18x18 in cube.Minor adjustments were made to the corner brackets, and they were printed to be much stronger to be used on the robot.

41, Oct 02: Varun Aggarwal commented on Build Practice Programming Bot: Learn Sensors - Sept 29: We were able to get the color sensor to correctly read the colors from the beacon. We created a simple program that made the robot turn until it was facing the correct color on the beacon, which worked very well.
41, Oct 02: Varun Aggarwal commented on Build Practice Programming Bot: Learn Sensors - Sept 30: We wrote a new autonomous holonomic drive method with automatic correction to the expected angle of the robot. Did not have time to test.
41, Oct 02: Varun Aggarwal commented on Build Practice Programming Bot: Play with Autonomous - Sept 21: We wrote 2 different methods for driving using the holonomic system. The autonomous version takes two inputs, a drive speed and an angle, and uses them to move the robot at the expected speed and angle. We did not have time to test.
41, Oct 02: Varun Aggarwal commented on Build Practice Programming Bot: Play with Autonomous - Sept 22: Tested out the holonomic drive method. It works, but the weight imbalance of the robot causes it to turn when it should be moving in a straight line. Began to write an automatic correction for this, but did not have time to complete.
41, Oct 02: Varun Aggarwal commented on Build Practice Programming Bot: Play with Autonomous - Sept 30: Modified the autonomous holonomic drive method to include a simple auto-correction using the gyroscope, but did not have time to test.

42, Oct 11: Seba Villaloboss commented on "Phase Two": Design Matrix/Planning - Discussed on Monday, 10/9

We defined Phase Two to be the design and build of a second functional mechanism on the robot. The two paths to gain points that we considered were the cap ball capping and shooting balls into the center vortex. We compared four options (reloadable shooter, non-reloadable shooter, cap ball, and cap ball + NR shooter) in terms of their guaranteed and potential score, reliability, and difficulty to build. We determined the cap ball was the most efficient choice, and if we were able two, we should build a non-reloadable shooter to accompany the cap ball mechanism.

42, Oct 11: Seba Villaloboss commented on "Phase Two": Design/Concept - Discussed on Monday 10/9
After deciding on the cap ball for Phase Two, we got to work conceptualizing the mechanisms we'd need to be successful. We broke it down into three functions; grasping the ball, lifting the ball, and supporting the robot's balance while lifting. To grasp the ball, we designed a mechanism that turns two arms made of PVC pipe covered in rubber matting using a motor on a chain. This assembly will be lifted by two extension lift rigged with a chain loop. This lift will be made out of a thinner version of 8020. Lastly, a sort of ball bearing wheel, lowered by a servo, will provide stability to the robot as it raises the cap ball.

43, Oct 20: Joshua Fu commented on Homecoming Fundraising - Somewhat belated, but all a donor has generously offered to cover the cost of all the drinks. The drinks have been bought, prices set ($1), and we have decided to have one central "station" with a table, and smaller stations flanking the central one a little ways off. Posters are going to be made by Danny, and whiteboards can be used as backups. Black zipper bags have been decided as the container to hold the money.

44, Oct 24: Dominic Canora commented on Two Beacon Auto - Auto has been improving steadily for the past few meetings. We can currently drive to the beacon, line up on the white line, detect which side is our alliance color, and deploy our button pusher on the correct side. Waiting for the builders to make our button pusher more accurate to continue on. It looks like we should be done by our first competition.

47, Nov 17: Dominic Canora commented on Two Beacon Auto - At meet one, our auto worked almost flawlessly. The only issues were, our beacon pressing mechanism was way too low since apparently our school's DIY field was made incorrectly. In addition, the "wiggle" that our robot does between beacons sometimes messed up finding the second line, since the back color sensor was too far back to see it. Between now and our next competition, we're going to build a different, more efficient, reliable, and more tolerant beacon mechanism, adjust our auto for our new, faster motors, and tune the drive train math to get rid of the wiggle.

50, Dec 08: Dominic Canora commented on Two Beacon Auto - Our auto was updated to use 40:1 motors (as opposed to the 60:1s that we had before) and worked flawlessly again at our second tournament. We also added a strafe right at the end of our auto to knock the cap ball off the center vortex because we had extra time due to faster motors. I hesitate to say it, but I think auto is done for the season.

50, Dec 08: Dominic Canora commented on Judgement Day Presentation: Script - 12/6: Created a bulleted list of points to touch on during our presentation, based off of the Quality Elements in the team awards guide. We have a LOT to say, and I think the hardest part of our presentation is figuring out what we can take out. I'm so excited to have a hopefully stellar judging score, I think it can happen this year if we all give it 100%.
50, Dec 08: PJ Hughes commented on Midseason Video - The video was completely filmed and edited before the deadline, and it has been submitted to the league for judging.
50, Dec 08: Dominic Canora commented on Judgement Day Presentation: Script - Started to organize our bullet points into a structured presentation that flows well, and started to assign the talking points to team members.

2, Jan 09: PJ Hughes commented on Non Reloadable Shooter - We discovered that the motors we had already in our workshop were not working for shooting the balls, even after we tried gearing them up as well as other ways to make them faster to shoot successfully. Instead of wasting more time on these methods though, we decided to go ahead and purchase a few 4:1 ratio motors. Hopefully these will come in soon and allow us to succeed in creating our non reloadible shooter.

Instead of pressing the buttons with two servos, we physically ram our robot into the beacon.
2, Jan 11: Seba Villaloboss commented on "Phase Two": Prototype - The REV Robotics linear slides arrived some time in November, and those were lightly experimented with throughout the month, and we were able to make it rise by pulling a string at the bottom led through the set of slides by bearings.

4, Jan 23: Armaan Shaikh commented on Judgement Day Presentation - Looking back on judgement day everything went well. We mixed up some of our lines in the judging presentation, but we got all of our information across to the judges and they were well understanding. In the robot presentation we did really well, and the judges asked really good questions about colleges and our inspiration for the unique design of the robot. 1/23/17
4, Jan 23: Armaan Shaikh commented on Non Reloadable Shooter - We received the motors we ordered and split into two groups. One group would pursue the original idea of having one wheel spinning with a secured channel to provide pressure, however instead of using a channel we decided to switch to two wheels spinning(similar to the way baseball launchers work). The other group of students went with a flicking design with two pieces of acrylic attached to a channel that is pulled down using a motor. Both of these are currently in their latter stages of prototyping however they are not finalized.
